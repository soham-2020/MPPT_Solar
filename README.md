High-Efficiency Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for Photovoltaic Systems

Project Overview

This project presents a robust and self-contained Simulink model for achieving Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) in a Photovoltaic (PV) energy generation system. The primary goal is to maximize the energy harvested from the solar array under varying conditions (irradiance and temperature) by dynamically adjusting the load impedance via a Boost Converter.

This work demonstrates expertise in power electronics design, control systems implementation, and renewable energy modeling.

 Key Features & Technical Highlights

1. Advanced MPPT Control Implementation

Algorithm: Utilized the Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm, implemented via a custom MATLAB Function block, to continuously seek the maximum power point (MPP) of the PV array.

Performance: Achieves fast tracking speed and minimizes oscillation around the MPP, crucial for real-world energy generation efficiency.

2. Power Electronics Integration

DC-DC Boost Converter: Modeled a high-frequency switching Boost Converter circuit to interface the PV array with the load, enabling the system to operate at the optimal voltage (Vmp).

PWM Generation: Designed the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) generator for precise duty cycle control (D), directly linking the control algorithm output to the power stage.

3. Realistic System Modeling

Photovoltaic Array: Modeled the non-linear V-I characteristics of a solar array, accounting for key environmental variables: Irradiance (Ir) and Temperature (T).

System Stability: Ensured system stability and transient response performance across various step changes in irradiance and load conditions.
